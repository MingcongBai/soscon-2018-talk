[H] How it all started...
-----------------------------

- AOSC did not start with a goal to promote open source or (much less) the Free 
  Software Movement.
	- Almost hilariously (clich√©), it started with a read of "Steve Jobs", his
	  biography at night.
	- NeXT, and the spirit of craftsmanship.
	- Politics class, the importance of Created in China.
	- Well here we go, one man against the world.
- Followers exists, but they joined the "cause", not the "action".

[H] Misleading Goals and the "Development Team"
-----------------------------------------------

- Seeing fame as the fuel of involvement? "Genius middle school developer", yuck.
- Bureaucracy and politics, formality over functionality.
- // TODO

[H] The Push for Community
--------------------------

- Community formed on December 1st of 2012.
- Community does not form simply because it's called that.
	- Lessons to be learnt?
	- Contribution and collaboration, and the sense of belonging and existence in 
	  a community.
- Temptations for fame, the dream of mass coverage and involvement.
	- Evaluation of the tasks of an individual and the community within the world.
	- Smashing the mirror and finding excuses.
- Refusal to learn.

[H] Silence
-----------

- Final lesson, quarrel at the Tieba, and yet another letter of excuses.
	- What is a community that only sales itself?
- A realisation to settle down in technologies.
- The poisonous pill of a "gated community".

[H] The Importance and Methodologies for Recognition
----------------------------------------------------

- Culture of AOSC, to recognise professional and scientific attitudes...
- More in the last section.

[T] AOSC OS
-----------

- What started it all, and still drives it all.
- // TODO

[T] Localisation
----------------

- The importance of localisation, and the lack thereof.
	- The "convenience" and "consistency" of English UIs.
	- Just an ideological goal with statistics?
	- Not everyone's willing to use English, as standardised as it is.
- Localisation aids in understanding - though only with good ones.
- Localisation as a channel of upstream interaction.
	- The "personal" business of open source involvement - connections.
- At the very least, a good way to allow for utilisation of non-technical skills, 
  to further boost contribution and involvement from the downstream level.

[T] Failing Projects and the Dealings
-------------------------------------

[C] Culture of AOSC, and Some Allures
-------------------------------------

- "AOSC's one and only pursuit is for the advancement of open technologies that 
  benefits technology users like us who work for the community, and you who 
  enjoys results from our effort."
- Endorsement of volunteer work and hobby-driven involvement.
- Emphases on techonology and a sphere of common "special" interest.
	- Rejection of those that does not serve the purpose.
	- Geographic and political neutralism.
- AOSC OS will never try and be endorsed by the FSF...
	- What works best and are allowed to redistribute are acceptable.
	- If the users ask for it, our job is to provide, or to explain why it could
	  not be provided.
	- ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY? What does it mean to a user, and their deserved 
	  respect?
	- What is "Free as in Freedom"?
- [All those aside...] How are people in AOSC like, and what does AOSC welcome?

[C] What is a Community to the Ecosystem of F/OSS
-------------------------------------------------

- See it as a local "hub" or "office" for a world-level involvement.
- A downstream community such as AOSC acts as the first proving ground for many
  involved, a relatively safe and relaxing environment to gain skills.
	- This could vary, of course.
- We are limited to our scope and confined to our own project.
	- However, it should be considered a basic principle for a community to value
	  and respect contribution to the upstream.
	- It is not a requirement however.
- However, we are empowered to act as a collective, and are (potentially) capable
  of change... Localisation, for example.
	- Oh boy that was fun with GNOME.

[C] Recognising the God?
------------------------

- In an open source community, especially in a volunteer setting, developers
  deserve to be respected and understood with their time constraints and
  contributions.
	- To an extent, these developers are free of blames - they could still be
	  terrible, of course.
- However, developers should not detach themselves from the community.
	- A community where users could not casually talk to developers and that the
	  developers see users as superiors is no community, but a team-audience
	  cooperative.
	- Typical open source community?
		- Stereotypes... Disappearing developers, "stupid questions", and quiet
		  chatting groups/mailing lists.
	- People are here to have fun and to (hopefully) find something useful for
	  themselves...
		- Finding a good tool for their work, say, AOSC OS as it might be.
		- To prove, improve, or show-off their skills.
		- Just about anything, maybe just finding some good chat mates.

[C] Make It More Like a School Club, But No Less a Congress
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Again, people are here to have fun and find whatever goal they may have, in
  which the community may benefit to its own set of goals.
	- It's no negotiation but a happy coincidence.
- A community is no democracy...
	- While each of the leading figures of a specific sub-project needs to take
	  charge and (try to) ensure its survival, there is no need to segregate tasks
	  and filter opinions.
	- Interest groups (sub-projects) should exist to allow for more freedom for
	  each of them.
- Debates must be welcome and recognised as a healthy and helpful procedure 
  toward decision making. However, one must stand to make the call if a democratic
  process is hindered by lack of interest (the rest is up for self-evaluation).
- Though above all, a community rely on a specific set of "cultural understanding"
  and elements of agreement. A community that tries to satisfy all may have
  democracy, but is no sustainable community.
